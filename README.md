# Shell-Hacks-Energy-prediction-model
## studies show that 35% of home energy consumption in the U.S. is wasted energy that's energy you're paying for, but isn't doing you any good
- As the inflation rising everyday, even a small amount of saving can be worth it and a big amount of energy is wasted now a days because of it's access amount.
- By our machine learning model we have trained it to get the prediction of energy that is used every year to reduce the waste of energy and save some money.
